# Data_Analysis_RMS_Titanic

Data_Analysis_RMS_Titanic is a Jupyter Notebook data analysis of the passengers on the RMS Titanic. The notebooks analysis passengers survivability rate depending on age, sex and cabin class. The data was not 100% clean so I had to do some data wrangling and cleaning to properly prepare and ETA on the data.

## Installation

No installation required, just open with any IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks, or click the link above the notebook to open with Google Colabs ( Preferred)


## Usage
If you want to run the file, on the second block of code, please comment out.

```titanic_df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/general/Assignment 3/titanic_data.csv')```

and uncomment out.
